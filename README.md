847J
======================

_847J_ provides `Optional` and some functional interfaces for Java 7, which are introduced in Java 8.

Those classes/interfaces belong to the packages under `org.koherent`. For example `Optional` provided by _847J_ which has compatible APIs with `java.util.Optional` is provided as `org.koherent.java.util.Optional`. That is because making custom classes/interfaces under the `java.util` package is forbidden.
